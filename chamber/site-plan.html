        <p>A comprehensive plan for the "Lagos Online Property Agent Platform" website.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <h3>LagosOnlineProperties</h3>
        <p>This name was chosen for its direct relevance to the project's focus: providing online property services
            specifically within Lagos. "LagosOnlineProperties" is memorable, clearly indicates the geographic scope, and
            immediately communicates the website's purpose to potential users. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The "Lagos Online Property Agent Platform" aims to be the premier online destination for individuals and
            businesses seeking to buy, sell, or rent properties within Lagos, Nigeria. The platform will connect
            property seekers with reputable real estate agents, offering a comprehensive database of listings including
            residential homes, commercial spaces, and land. Users will be able to search and filter properties based on
            criteria such as location, price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and property type. Each listing will
            offer essential information like property address, pricing, key features, a descriptive overview, and
            contact details for the respective agent or owner. While primarily a search and information portal, it will
            also include a contact form for general inquiries or for users to express interest in listing their own
            properties. The site will provide a user-friendly interface to streamline the property search process and
            facilitate efficient communication between all parties involved.</p>

        <h3>Website Pages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home Page (index.html):</strong> This landing page will introduce the platform, highlighting its
                purpose and key benefits. It will feature a visually appealing hero section, showcase "featured
                properties" to entice users, and briefly explain how the platform works. Its goal is to provide an
                inviting entry point and guide users to the property listings.</li>
            <li><strong>Properties Page (properties.html):</strong> This is the core of the platform, displaying a
                dynamic grid of all available property listings. Users will interact with a robust filtering system to
                narrow down their search results. Clicking on a property will trigger a modal dialog, revealing more
                in-depth details about that specific listing.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Page (contact.html):</strong> This page will provide various ways for users to get in
                touch, including a detailed contact form, email address, phone number, and business hours. It will also
                include links to social media profiles. Upon submission, the form will direct users to a separate
                success page displaying the submitted data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>The chosen colors are designed to evoke professionalism, trustworthiness, and a clean aesthetic.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="color-box primary-color-box"></div>
                <strong>Primary Color: #007BFF (A shade of Blue)</strong>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Used for headings (H1, H2), active navigation links, buttons (e.g., "Search,"
                    "Contact Agent"), borders for prominent sections, and potentially the site logo. This color
                    signifies reliability and modernity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="color-box secondary-color-box"></div>
                <strong>Secondary Color: #F8F9FA (Light Grey)</strong>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Primarily used for the general background of the website. This light neutral
                    color ensures readability and provides a clean canvas for content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="color-box text-color-box"></div>
                <strong>Text Color: #343A40 (Dark Grey)</strong>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Applied to all main body paragraphs, labels, and general text. This dark grey
                    provides excellent contrast against the light background for optimal readability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="color-box accent-color-box"></div>
                <strong>Accent Color: #28A745 (Green)</strong>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Used for smaller, impactful elements such as "For Sale" or "For Rent" tags on
                    listings, success messages, and icons that draw attention to specific features. This color
                    represents growth and positive outcomes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>A combination of a strong, modern sans-serif for headings and a highly readable sans-serif for body text will
            be used to ensure clarity and a professional appearance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3 class="font-montserrat">Montserrat, sans-serif</h3>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Applied to all primary headings (H1, H2, H3) and potentially important
                    call-to-action text. Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif that offers a clean, contemporary feel,
                    making headings stand out.</p>
                <h1 class="font-montserrat">Example Heading 1</h1>
                <h2 class="font-montserrat">Example Heading 2</h2>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="font-open-sans">Open Sans, sans-serif</h3>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Used for all body text, paragraphs, descriptions, navigation links, and form
                    input fields. Open Sans is highly legible across various screen sizes and provides a friendly yet
                    professional tone for the main content.</p>
                <p class="font-open-sans">This is an example of body text using Open Sans. It is clear and easy to read,
                    ensuring a good user experience.</p>
